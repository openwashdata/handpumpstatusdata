Institutional Factors – Availability government staff, committee permission inspection. Functionality & Condition – Operational status, water availability, flow rate measurements, strokes discharge, mechanical condition. Environmental Hazards – Presence latrines, cemeteries, waste, rivers, lakes, flood-prone areas, difficult terrain within 50m. Repair & Maintenance History – Borehole age, manufacturer, installation details, prior repairs, spare parts required, operational feel. Documentation – Photographs water point repair parts. Purpose dataset supports rural water supply monitoring, maintenance planning, public health risk assessments, contributing efforts improve sustainability reliability community water points. Potential Users dataset can valuable : Local Governments – planning maintenance schedules allocating resources priority water points. NGOs & Development Partners – designing interventions improve rural water supply sustainability. Researchers & Public Health Experts – studying impact infrastructure condition water access health outcomes. Donors & Funding Agencies – monitoring effectiveness investments water infrastructure. Community-Based Organizations – advocating improved water services mobilizing community-led repairs.","code":""},{"path":"https://github.com/openwashdata/handpumpstatusdata/index.html","id":"installation","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Installation","title":"Chiradzulu Handpump Functionality Verification Survey","text":"can install development version handpumpstatusdata GitHub : Alternatively, can download individual datasets CSV XLSX file table .
